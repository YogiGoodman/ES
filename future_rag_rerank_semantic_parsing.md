# ðŸš€ Next Iterations After Hybrid Search

After building a solid Hybrid Search engine, the next steps involve bringing more intelligence into the pipeline. Here are the next two evolution stages:

---

## ðŸ§  1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**What is RAG?**
RAG combines your vector search backend with a generative model (like GPT or LLaMA) to answer questions in natural language using retrieved documents as context.

### âœ¨ Use Case Example:
**Query:** "Why did the wind speed spike last week in Phoenix?"

- **Vector Search:** Retrieves top 5 documents mentioning Phoenix and wind speed anomalies.
- **LLM Input:** "Answer based on these documents:
[Top 5 Docs]
Q: Why did the wind speed spike last week?"
- **Response:** "According to sensor_42 in Phoenix, the spike was due to a sudden storm front..."

### ðŸ§ª Implementation:
```python
def rag_response(query_text):
    docs = hybrid_search(query_text, top_k=5)
    context = "
".join([doc["notes"] for doc in docs if isinstance(doc, dict) and "notes" in doc])
    prompt = f"Answer the question based on the following logs:
{context}

Q: {query_text}
A:"

    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
```

## ðŸŽ¯ 2. Semantic Parsing (Field-Aware Query Understanding)

**What is Semantic Parsing?**
Automatically extracts structured field constraints from natural language queries and converts them into filters for hybrid search.

### âœ¨ Use Case Example:
**Query:** "Show me active weather sensors in Phoenix with humidity over 70"

- **Extracted Filters:**
```json
{
  "status": "Active",
  "industry": "Weather",
  "location": "Phoenix",
  "humidity": {"gt": 70}
}
```

### ðŸ§ª Implementation:
```python
import re

def extract_filters(query):
    filters = []
    if "active" in query.lower():
        filters.append({"term": {"status": "Active"}})
    if "weather" in query.lower():
        filters.append({"term": {"industry": "Weather"}})
    if "phoenix" in query.lower():
        filters.append({"term": {"location": "Phoenix"}})
    if "humidity over" in query.lower():
        match = re.search(r"humidity over (\d+)", query.lower())
        if match:
            filters.append({"range": {"humidity": {"gt": int(match.group(1))}}})
    return filters
```

---

## ðŸª„ 3. Reranking (Optional Post-Processing)

**What is Reranking?**
Applies a deeper model (e.g., cross-encoder or GPT) to reorder the top-k retrieved documents based on true relevance.

### âœ¨ Use Case Example:
- Hybrid search gives 5 documents, but some are only partially related.
- Reranker reorders based on deep understanding of user query and full document content.

### ðŸ§ª Implementation:
```python
def rerank(query_text, docs):
    reranked = sorted(
        docs,
        key=lambda doc: model_cross.encode(f"{query_text} [SEP] {doc['combined_text']}", convert_to_tensor=True).mean(),
        reverse=True
    )
    return reranked
```
